**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
* You don't have access to your local repository but want to edit, update some content
* You urgently need to do some changes in production before staging


**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**
* Because you might not want to see your repository updated by data from somebody else who have pushed their changes before you

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?**

* Fork exists to retrieve data from GitHub of another user directly to your GitHub account without having to put it on your machine. Additionaly, it's a way to leave a link to the author
* Clone enables you to retrieve data from a remote git repository to your own machine
* Branches enables you to create additional parallels version of your code base
* I would you fork to retrieve a repo from GitHub, clone to put it on my direcoty and branches to experiment on it before changing it.
