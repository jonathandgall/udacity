            <p class="descriptionText">The violet-backed starling (Cinnyricinclus leucogaster), also known as the plum-coloured starling or amethyst starling, is a relatively small species of starling in the family Sturnidae. C. leucogaster is a sexually dimorphic species in which the males possess an iridescent violet back whilst the females are brown. During breeding, the female will incubate 2-4 eggs (these are pale blue with reddish/brown spots) for 12â€“14 days. The male will help feed chicks until they fledge after about 21 days.
