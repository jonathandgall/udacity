**How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?**

Thanks to diff, I can see the difference between the old and the new file

**How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?**

It's more easy to find out the issues linked to code errors. Git gives me much more control over what I want to save, preventing to fill my log with un-logical saves like it would be with google doc for example.

**What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?**

Main pro is I believe that you can finegrain the steps you want to save. The main cons, you can forget a critical save

**Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?**

Git is have a philosophy of getting the ability to save a full project, versus google docs focusing on signle files. You can always go back so no risks to try somethng new. When you work on a project, you often have multiple changes interacting together, and you want to keep the logical explanation between them. That's why commiting multiple files at the same times make a lot of sense in that context

**How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?**
Git log gives you all the history of commit and git diff gives you the information about the differences between those commits

**How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?**
	
Thanks to version control, you know that even if you introduce an error at any point in time, you still have an easy way out by checking the previous version and seeing what went wrongly

**Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?**
Use version control to experiment as much as possible and become the best developer I can be
