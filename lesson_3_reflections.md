#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?#

* You don't have access to your local repository but want to edit, update some content
* You urgently need to do some changes in production before staging


#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?#

* Because you might not want to see your repository updated by data from somebody else who have pushed their changes before you
