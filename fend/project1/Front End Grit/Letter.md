# From a friend

Hello Jonathan,

I hope this email finds you well. I know some things about you. I know that you are in a good professional and personal situation in your adopted country. You have an interesting job and a fantastic relationship with your loved one. And finally, a great environment of study.

I also know that you feel frustrated. Things are not the way you thought they should be. You would like to be able to call yourself a developer. You are not. You are at most the facade of one. I know you want to create things, you want to build, ship and show the fruits of your imagination. You want your loved ones to be proud of you.

*How do I know all that?*

I am someone you want to help right now. I am you. Just, a few years older, even thought my glowing white hair tends to betray my age. And believe me, from where I stand, I can tell you: **everything will be alright**. It took time and events of life, but you finally just put yourself in a position of success. A simple and satisfactory success. 

I know you started to study everyday a few hours, keeping a steady rhythm and doing your best. For the first time, you can actually do it in piece of mind. You have no extra work to take upon you and no more responsibilities on others' life. That is good. Believe me, it will pay back in its time. You will go through rough moments of doubts and solitude due to your physical isolation. But the lack of distraction and your consequent focus will be beneficial for you on the long term. Believe me.

You have found a fantastic resource to learn in Udacity. It is format that finally suits you, and you will follow it for years to come. You are building your own catalogue of more practical resources. Links on Reddit or StackOverflow, bookmarks in the books you read, you name it. You started to create your mind palace which will prove to be a great bonus. The plan that you are creating right now in your brain is becoming more and more clear. The work you did on yourself to be well prepared and organized just start to bear its fruits.

**Trust your instincts. Continue to plan everything. Keep your rhythm. Note and remember the lessons learned.**

Do it for us, I thank you for that.

Your friend.
