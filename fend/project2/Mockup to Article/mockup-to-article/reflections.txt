Your response goes here!

* I learned about the organisation of a webpage and how semantic is the structure of the code on a page, that tags enables you to precise how you want your information to be interpreted via the browser. I also learned about the those tags can be organised as trees, with tags being parents, children or siblings.
* The easier part for me was the semantic aspect, as it didn't change since the first version of HTML.
* Nothing was particularly difficult at this point.
* Using the tags learned during the class and the incredible resource which is MDN, it wasn't difficult to find the tags needed to create the prototype.
